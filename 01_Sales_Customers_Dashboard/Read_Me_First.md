This project focuses on building a **complete Business Intelligence solution** to analyze **sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency** using a real-world dataset.  
The main objectives are:

✔ Identify **top-selling products, revenue trends, and seasonal patterns**  
✔ Perform **customer segmentation** (new vs returning, high-value customers)  
✔ Track **order fulfillment efficiency** and delivery performance  
✔ Visualize **KPIs for decision-making** through dynamic dashboards  

By combining **data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization**, this project simulates a real business environment where decision-makers rely on accurate, timely data to improve strategy and performance.
