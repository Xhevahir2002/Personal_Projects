<br>

This project follows a structured pipeline to ensure clean, reliable, and actionable data:  

1. **Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)**  
   âœ” Import raw CSV files from multiple sources  
   âœ” Handle missing values, normalize formats (dates, categories)  
   âœ” Merge tables to create a single clean dataset  

2. **SQL (Database Modeling & Query Optimization)**  
   âœ” Design normalized schema to store data  
   âœ” Write optimized queries for aggregations and joins  
   âœ” Prepare data subsets for reporting and analysis  

3. **Excel (Validation & Pre-Analysis)**  
   âœ” Validate cleaned data using pivot tables  
   âœ” Perform initial descriptive analytics  
   âœ” Check consistency before BI integration  

4. **Power BI (Visualization & Dashboarding)**  
   âœ” Build **interactive dashboards** with KPIs  
   âœ” Integrate **live queries** for real-time decision-making  
   âœ” Create filters for customer segments, regions, and product categories
