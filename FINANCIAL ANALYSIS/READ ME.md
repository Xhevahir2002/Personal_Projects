> In my resume, I refer that I make Financial Analysis using "Finan Expert". Unfortunately, I was able to use that tool only at the university, not at my house, because that was the licensing type that licensor gave to university. The only thing I can do, is to write down what did I do with that tool.

1. Finding financial statements of a company (at least for the last 3 years. In my case was a Greek company)
2. Registration of the data in appropriate forms which had the form required by the Greek Accounting Standards
3. Data usage in order to create graphs where I can see the performance of the company year-by-year in many financial ratios such as Quick Ratio, Cash Ratio, Defensive Interval etc.
4. Create report where the company is evaluated for all financial ratios and if it performs poorly in any ratio, I'll get warnings about it.
